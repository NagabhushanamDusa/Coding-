        <strong>HTML</strong> stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it look and function better.

                How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an <strong>.html extension</strong>. Browsers read these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render the formatted content on your screen.
